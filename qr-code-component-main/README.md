## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During this exercise i learned how important it is to properly structure websites/ webpages in needed and only necessary html tags, guring this process i placed all my contents in a div tag, which were not needed, they only crowded my code, and gave me extra work, i had to start afresh, so lets keep our pages well structed.

### Continued development

I am currently focusing on learning react, and will proceed with other frontend developer exercises.

### Useful resources

- [Centering Divs](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20this%20by,the%20div) - This was helpful in centering the boxes in this exercise, highly recommended.
- [Working with Images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
