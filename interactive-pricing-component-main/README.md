## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Local Storage
  

### What I learned

In this exercise i put my javascript to test by implementing a price slider and discount bar. I added a dark-mode and default color scheme design to it.

### Useful resources

- [Using AJAX setInterval()](https://whitefoxcreative.com/developers/ajax/refresh-a-section-of-a-page-at-specific-intervals-using-ajax/) - This article helped me in figuring out how to automatically refreshing the price when the discount is checked.
- [LocalStorage for Darkmode](https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/EMdjOV) - This code live demo which helped me in understanding LocalStorage
